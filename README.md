### Quick Notes ✍️

📍 Linked Lists: linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.

📍 Queues: a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence.

📍 Stacks: an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations (push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed). Also known as LIFO (last in, first out).
